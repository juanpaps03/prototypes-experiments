# Prototypes project

The whole idea of this projects is to have a place where I can add all the  things I have learned on this years.

Working in software development for companies has one major disadvantage, everything I learn is private 
and owned by the company. To start mitigating this, I'm creating this project.

Here, I will add business-free prototypes, meaning the data and logic of this project might not make sense, and 
thatâ€™s okay. The focus is solely on sharing as much technical knowledge as possible (and for my future reference).

Of course, this will be an ongoing project, hopefully a never-ending, the goal is to keep learning forever
