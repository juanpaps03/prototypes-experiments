# Prototypes project

The whole idea of this projects is to have a place where I can add all the  things I have learned on this years.

Working in software development with companies has one bid disadvantage, which is that everything I learned, is private 
and owned by the company, in order to start to mitigate this, I'm creating this project.

Here I will add business free prototypes, which means that the data and logic of this  project could make no sense, 
and thats okay, because here I'm focusing only in share (and also for my later) all the technical knowledge possible.

Of course, this will be a ongoing project, hopefully a never ending one, since the idea is always keep learning
